# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jack!

**NOW:** DevOps Engineer for the last 2+ years, working primarly on helping teams reduce their TTD (time-to-delivery) and meet SLO's when deploying applications, primarly in to Openshift/Kuberbetes environments, but also in AWS and to a lesser extent Azure. I greatly enjoy creating just-about-everything-as-code using things like Terraform, Packer, Ansible, Pulumi, and Helm, to name but a few, and have had plenty of experience doing so. I'm also a huge proponent of GitOps, and will take any opportunity to implement it!

**PREVIOUSLY:** Once upon a time, a full-stack developer primarily working with Typescript/Node.js/Java and React/Angular for 3 years before that, among other things. Before that, I briefly worked on a global SaaS solution implemented using C#, so that's somewhere in the back of my brain if you need it!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing a decentralised CI solution in k8s/openshift, building in governance, assurance, and security.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang/Gotpl for building Operators/Helm charts
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how much time I spend spinning Jenkins up and trying to figure out optimal k8s quotas.
- ðŸ’¬ Don't ask me about how much time I spend spinning Jenkins down and trying to figure out optimal k8s quotas.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Here!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have about 8 Raspberry Pi's of all generations, all of which are (currently) doing precisely nothing.
