# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jack!

**NOW:** DevOps engineer with 5+ years of experience in Software Engineering teams, most recently working on building internal, common services, and CICD tools for teams to consume, and helping disparate teams deliver and deploy secure containers in to on-premises Openshift/Kubernetes environments and AWS. Previous experience as a software engineer has exposed me to a huge cross-section of technologies, languages, and practices, and my current DevOps role has also involved incorporating and establishing various basic SRE practises. I greatly enjoy creating just-about-everything-as-code using things like Terraform, Packer, Ansible, Pulumi, and Helm, to name but a few, and have had plenty of experience doing so. I'm also a huge proponent of GitOps, and will take any opportunity to convert people.

**PREVIOUSLY:** Once upon a time, a full-stack developer primarily working with Typescript/Node.js/Java and React/Angular for 3 years, among other things. Before that, I briefly worked as a C# Software Engineer on a global SaaS solution.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing a decentralised CI solution in k8s/openshift, building in governance, assurance, and security.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang/Gotpl for building Operators/Helm charts
- ðŸ’¬ Don't ask me about how much time I've spent spinning Jenkins up and down, because it makes me shudder.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Here?
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can learn, and then subsequently unlearn RegEx within a matter of minutes, and tend to perform this trick at least once a week.
