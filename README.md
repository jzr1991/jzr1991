# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jack!

NOW: DevOps Engineer for the last two years, working primarly on deploying applications inside Openshift/Kubernetes clusters but also inside AWS, in particular leveraging services like EKS, ECR, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Amplify... to name but a few. I've also had lots of experience with Linux, deploying applications to bare metal server on-prem, primarly on RHEL/Centos flavour hosts. Love creating just-about-everything-as-code using things like Terraform, Packer, Ansible, Pulumi, and Helm, to name but a few, and have had plenty of experience doing so. Also a huge proponent of GitOps and always looking for a reason to store something in Git!

PREVIOUSLY: Once upon a time, a full-stack developer primarily working with Typescript/Node.js/Java and React/Angular for 3 years before that, among other things. Before that, I briefly worked on a global SaaS solution implemented using C#, so that's somewhere in the back of my brain if you need it!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing a decentralised CI solution in k8s/openshift, building in governance, assurance, and security.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang/Gotpl for building Operators/Helm charts
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how much time I spend spinning Jenkins up and trying to figure out optimal k8s quotas.
- ðŸ’¬ Don't ask me about how much time I spend spinning Jenkins down and trying to figure out optimal k8s quotas.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Here!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have about 8 Raspberry Pi's of all generations, all of which are (currently) doing precisely nothing.
