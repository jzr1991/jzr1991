# Hi there ğŸ‘‹

DevOps Engineer for the last two years, formerly a full-stack developer primarily with ^[Jj]ava(|script)$ for 3 years before that.

I work primarily with Kubernetes/Openshift to create generic pipelines consumable by teams, no matter the language, stack, or branch strat.


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a reusable template pipeline in k8s, using Jenkins Templating Engine
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Gotpl for Helm and interesting Grafana visualisations.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about how much time I spend spinning Jenkins up.
- ğŸ’¬ Don't ask me about how much time I spend spinning Jenkins down.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Here!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spend too much time spinning Jenkins up and down
