# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

DevOps Engineer for the last two years, a full-stack developer primarily working with ^[Jj]ava(|script)$ and React/Angular for 3 years before that, among other things. Previously previously, working on a C# SaaS solution.

I currework primarily with Kubernetes/Openshift to create generic pipelines consumable by teams, no matter the language, stack, or branch strat.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing a decentralised CI solution in k8s/openshift, building in governance, assurance, and security.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang/Gotpl for building Operators/Helm charts
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how much time I spend spinning Jenkins up and trying to figure out optimal k8s quotas.
- ðŸ’¬ Don't ask me about how much time I spend spinning Jenkins down and trying to figure out optimal k8s quotas.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Here!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have about 8 Raspberry Pi's of all generations, all of which are (currently) doing precisely nothing.
